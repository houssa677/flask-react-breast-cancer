# flask-react-breast-cancer

Flask–React Breast Cancer is a web-based application for breast cancer risk prediction and
feature correlation analysis. The backend, built with Flask and scikit-learn, exposes a
logistic regression model trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset and
generates correlation matrix heatmaps. The React frontend provides an interactive interface
to input tumour-related features, obtain predictions, and visualize correlation patterns
between the features.

This repository is designed to accompany the experiments on breast cancer classification and
to allow editors/reviewers to inspect and reproduce the main components of the application.

## 1. Overview

The goals of this project are to:

- perform **binary classification** (benign vs malignant tumour) using **logistic regression**,
- provide a **Flask API** that loads a trained model and serves predictions,
- generate and store **correlation matrices** for different feature groups (global, mean, error, worst),
- offer a **React**-based web interface for interactive prediction and visualization.

The application is split into two main parts:

- `backend/` – Python/Flask API, model training/loading (`model.py`), prediction logic, correlation image generation  
- `frontend/` – React application (JavaScript) for the user interface
