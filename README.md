# flask-react-breast-cancer

Flask–React Breast Cancer is a web-based application for breast cancer risk prediction and
feature correlation analysis. The backend, built with Flask and scikit-learn, exposes a
logistic regression model trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset and
generates correlation matrix heatmaps. The React frontend provides an interactive interface
to input tumour-related features, obtain predictions, and visualize correlation patterns
between the features.

This repository is designed to accompany the experiments on breast cancer classification and
to allow editors/reviewers to inspect and reproduce the main components of the application.

## 1. Overview

The goals of this project are to:

- perform **binary classification** (benign vs malignant tumour) using **logistic regression**,
- provide a **Flask API** that loads a trained model and serves predictions,
- generate and store **correlation matrices** for different feature groups (global, mean, error, worst),
- offer a **React**-based web interface for interactive prediction and visualization.

The application is split into two main parts:

- `backend/` – Python/Flask API, model training/loading (`model.py`), prediction logic, correlation image generation  
- `frontend/` – React application (JavaScript) for the user interface

3 Backend – Flask API and correlation matrices
3.1. Requirements

Python 3.x

Packages listed in backend/requirements.txt
(e.g. Flask, scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)

3.2. Installation

From the root of the repository:

cd backend

# (optional but recommended) create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/macOS:
# source venv/bin/activate

# install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.3. Training the model and generating correlation images (model.py)

The script backend/model.py:

loads the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset via
sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer(),

trains a logistic regression classifier,

generates correlation matrices for:

all features (global, 30 × 30),

mean features,

error (standard error) features,

worst features,

saves the trained model as model.pkl in the backend/ directory,

saves the correlation heatmaps as PNG images under backend/static/corr/.

You can run this script to (re)generate the model and correlation images:

cd backend
python model.py


After execution you should see:

backend/model.pkl

backend/static/corr/corr_global.png

backend/static/corr/corr_mean.png

backend/static/corr/corr_error.png

backend/static/corr/corr_worst.png

3.4. Running the Flask backend

Once the model and correlation images are available:

cd backend

# activate the virtual environment if not already active
venv\Scripts\activate  # or: source venv/bin/activate on Linux/macOS

# run the Flask app
python app.py
# or, if configured:
# flask run


By default, the Flask server typically runs on:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/


The Flask app handles:

loading model.pkl on startup,

receiving feature vectors from the frontend,

returning predicted class (benign/malignant) and probability,

serving correlation matrix images from static/corr/.

4. Frontend – React application
4.1. Requirements

Node.js and npm (or Yarn)

4.2. Installation

From the root of the repository:

cd frontend

# install JavaScript dependencies
npm install
# or:
# yarn install

4.3. Running the frontend
npm start
# or:
# yarn start


By default, the React development server runs on:

http://localhost:3000/


The frontend is configured to send API requests to the Flask backend (typically running
on http://127.0.0.1:5000/) and to display:

an input form for the breast cancer features,

the predicted probability and class (benign vs malignant),

the correlation matrices, usually fetched as images from backend/static/corr/.

The details of the HTTP requests (URL, method, JSON structure) can be inspected in
src/App.js or other frontend components.

5. Typical local workflow

Train the model and generate correlation images (using model.py):

cd backend
python model.py


Start the Flask backend:

cd backend
python app.py


Start the React frontend in a separate terminal:

cd frontend
npm start


Open the browser at:

http://localhost:3000/


Use the web interface to:

enter tumour-related features,

send a prediction request,

view the probability of malignancy and the predicted class,

inspect the correlation heatmaps between features.

6. Data and model

The application uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, available
through sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer().

The trained model is stored as backend/model.pkl and loaded by the backend on startup.

The dataset itself is not stored in this repository; it is fetched via scikit-learn, which
internally mirrors the public UCI dataset.

For reproducibility, the code that trains the model and generates the correlation matrices
is implemented in backend/model.py, so that the model and images can be regenerated.

7. Notes for reviewers and editors

The repository is self-contained: it includes the backend (Flask), the frontend (React),
the model training script (model.py), the serialized model (model.pkl), and the
correlation heatmaps.



The code and structure are intended to support a Technology and Code style article,
where both the methodology and the implementation are available for inspection.
